# 📝 Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST) – CNN Project
Recognize handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates how AI can read handwritten numbers, a powerful tool for educational technology and smart exam-checking systems.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Handwritten text varies widely, making automated recognition challenging. AI can help read such inputs, which is especially useful in education technology and automated grading.

## 🎯 Objective

- Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Achieve over 98% accuracy in digit prediction.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **MNIST**: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
- Loaded directly from Keras datasets.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (with Keras)
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Load Data:** Download MNIST from Keras.
2. **Preprocess Data:** Normalize images, one-hot encode labels.
3. **Build Model:** Design a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Train Model:** Fit the model to the training data.
5. **Evaluate:** Validate on the test set and report accuracy.
6. **(Optional) UI:** Draw and predict digits using a simple interface.
